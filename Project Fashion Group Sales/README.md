### Project Fashion Group Sales

I used a sales data set with over 70,000 rows for two fictitious fashion stores in Australia called Fashions Direct and Next Look. Then I formated the data into an Excel table, created pivot tables and a pivot charts to display the data on a dashboard. I used slicers to create the interactivity, and dynamic labels that respond to selections made in the slices.
