# excel-dashboards
This repository presents my learning projects that demonstrate my skills with Excel. 
I used datasheets to analyze data, created pivot tables then to present data in a visual form, 
created charts to visualize processes, and also created a dashboard that can be used to track and analyze data. 
The data in the dashboard can be changed depending on the selected categories, making it a very flexible and practical tool.
